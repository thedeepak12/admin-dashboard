# Admin Dashboard

This project is a clean and modern admin dashboard interface built using HTML and CSS. The dashboard features a sidebar with navigation, a dynamic header, project cards, and informational widgets. It mimics the structure of real-world dashboard applications, making it a great exercise in layout design, user interface development, and component structuring without JavaScript. The project is fully static and showcases how far you can go with just HTML and CSS.

## Features

- **Sidebar Navigation**: Includes links for Home, Profile, Messages, History, Tasks, Communities, and more, styled with SVG icons and hover animations.
- **Header with Search and Actions**: Search bar, notification icon, user avatar, and action buttons (New, Upload, Share).
